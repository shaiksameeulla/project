Pivotal tc Server contains all of vanilla Tomcat, and has a few optional extensions designed to make it easier to deploy and maintain. Broken out into three groups, the diff looks like this:

Configuration extensions (No altered code, just config changes we implement)

Multi-Instance using shared binaries
Trivial to change Tomcat versions while preserving app and configuration
Variable Substitution in config files
Async Logging
Mild Security Tuning (ports, mgmt apps, JMX)
Code Extensions

Patch version releases – fix flaws in current release [e.g. tomcat-7.0.32.B.RELEASE]
Extended JMX interface
Additional Metrics
Application Deployment
Diagnostics Valve - good troubleshooting info when there's a slowdown
Config Templates – including custom-created
Change log level on the fly
Advanced Session replication (Gemfire)
Oracle DB Connection Proxy
Add-Ons

Windows Service Wrapper
RPM / Apt-Get / Debian installers (linux)
Startup scripts (linux)
Chef Recipes
Puppet Scripts
Password Encryption
Spring Insight for performance tuning
Here's a deck I put together with a little more detail: http://www.slideshare.net/dcarwin/00-pivotaltc-serverextendsasftomcatexternalssv

FYI on the tag thing, there's still the old "springsource-tc-server" tag. SpringSource is now Pivotal. (Can/should we update the tag or add a new one?)

Hope this helps.
