Reject the Security Manager so it can be taken out in a later update. Java 1.0 version starts Security Manager. For several years, it was never the main method of protecting client-side code.





Sealed Classes & Interfaces : 
Sealed Classes were proposed by JEP 360 and delivered in JDK 15 as a preview feature. They were proposed again, with some refinements, and delivered in JDK 16 as a preview feature. Now in JDK 17, Sealed Classes are being finalized with no changes from JDK 16.
