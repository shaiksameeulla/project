Collection API Improvements
=====================
The Collection API in Java 8 now includes the following new methods. A few of them are listed below.  

This is a default method for the Iterator. forEachRemaining (Consumer action): This is a default method for the Iterator. It repeats the “action” for the remaining items until all of them have been processed, or the “action” throws an exception.
The default technique for removing items from a collection is removed (Predicate filter). This removes all objects from the collection that satisfy the supplied “filter.”
Spliterator () This collection method returns a spliterator object that may be used to traverse the items sequentially or in parallel.
ReplaceAll (), calculate(), and merge() are methods in the Map collection.
The performance of the HashMap class with Key collisions has been enhanced etc.


Java IO Improvements
=====================
The following are some of the IO enhancements made in Java 8:

Files.list (Path dir): Returns a lazily filled stream, each element of which represents a directory entry.
Files.lines (Path path): Reads all the lines from a stream.
Files.find (): Returns a stream filled by a path after searching for files in the file tree rooted at a provided beginning file and many more. 
BufferedReader.lines (): Returns a stream containing all of the elements of BufferedReader’s lines and much more
