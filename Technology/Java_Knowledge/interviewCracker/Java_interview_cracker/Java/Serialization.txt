Serialization :

In general there are three approaches to serialization in java:

1) Implement Serializable and use default protocol.
2) Implement Serializable and get a chance to modify the default protocol.
3) Implement Externalizable and write your own protocol to implement serailization.

Customize Java Serialization

We know Serializable is a java marker interface. When a class implements Serializable interface it gives information to the JVM that the instances of these classes can be serialized. Along with that, there is a special note to the JVM

look for following two methods in the class that implements Serializable. If found invoke that and continue with serialization process else directly follow the standard serialization protocol.

So this gives us a chance to write these two methods insided the Class that implements Serializable and you get a hook to the serialization process. You can write your custom code inside these two methods and customize the standard behaviour of serialization.

private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException;
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;

-----------------------
 ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;
 
  If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then
  the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value
  for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the
  Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification. 
   However, it is <em>strongly
  recommended</em> that all serializable classes explicitly declare
  serialVersionUID values,
  since the default serialVersionUID computation is
  highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler
  implementations, and can thus result in unexpected
  <code>InvalidClassException</code>s during deserialization.




/***99999******/
If the superclass is serializable but we don’t want the subclass to be serialized.

To prevent subclass from being serialized we must implement writeObject() and readObject() method and need to throw NotSerializableException from these methods.

I have modified the Lion class to include these two methods and on the fly I change a property of Lion to demonstrate this. This is not overriding or overloading methods and this is a mechanism provided by serialization. These two included methods are declared private but JVM can access the private methods of an object. There is no change to the class that does the serialization and de-serialization.

package basic.serialization.customization;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;

public class SampleSerialization implements Serializable {

	public int getSecNumber() {
		return secNumber;
	}

	public void setSecNumber(int secNumber) {
		this.secNumber = secNumber;
	}

	private String var1 = "var1";

	private String var2 = "var2";
	private transient int secNumber = 88;
	private transient String secName = "sami";

	public String getVar1() {
		return var1;
	}

	public void setVar1(String var1) {
		this.var1 = var1;
	}

	public String getVar2() {
		return var2;
	}

	public void setVar2(String var2) {
		this.var2 = var2;
	}

	private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
		setVar1("sami");
		out.defaultWriteObject();
		out.writeInt(secNumber);
		out.writeObject(secName);
	}

	private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
		in.defaultReadObject();
		secNumber = in.readInt();
		secName = (String) in.readObject();
	}

	public String getSecName() {
		return secName;
	}

	public void setSecName(String secName) {
		this.secName = secName;
	}

}

Inheritance:
-----------

Serialization is the process of changing the state of an object into the byte stream so that the byte stream can return back into a copy of the object

In Java, an object is said to be serializable if its class or parent classes implement either the Serializable interface or the Externalizable interface.

Deserialization is converting the serialized object back into a copy of the object.

There are three cases of Object Serialization with inheritance.

The child class is automatically serializable if the parent class is serializable

A child class can still be serialized even if the parent class is not serializable

If we want the child class not be serialized even if the parent class is serializable


During deserialization, the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class. A no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable. The fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from the stream.

Thus, default no-arg constructor of class Foo called of, resulted in initialization

Yes if superclass does not implement Serializable, it will not be serialized, so when deserialized,its default constructor will be called and default values will be allocated to all of its variables. 


Case 1:
	When superclass executes a Serializable interface and the subclass does not.
		In this case, the objects of the subclass get serialize directly due to serialization of the superclass, irrespective of subclass implements, or not implements the Serializable interface.

Case 2:	
	When the superclass is not implementing the Serializable interface and subclass implements.
		During serialization, any variable belonging to the non-serializable superclass, the value of this variable is ignored by JVM and the default value is stored in the file. And during de-serialization, JVM will execute instance control flow in the superclass. For this purpose, JVM will call the default constructor of the superclass. So every non-serializable superclass must contain default constructor, otherwise, we will get a runtime error. Let’s analyze both of the cases.

Case 3:
	When we need to serialize superclass but not to the subclass.
		This can be done by implementing the writeObject() during serialization and readObject()  during deserialization methods in the subclass and needs to throw NotSerializableException from these methods. So, we are actually overriding these methods to make custom serialization.

---------------------------------------------------
Externalizable ::

@Override
public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput oo) throws IOException 
{
    oo.writeObject(userName);
    oo.writeObject(roll);
}

@Override
public void readExternal(ObjectInput oi) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException 
{
    userName = (String)oi.readObject();
    roll = (Integer)oi.readObject();
}


Key differences between Serializable and Externalizable::
----------------------------------

Marker interface: Serializable is marker interface without any methods. Externalizable interface contains two methods: writeExternal() and readExternal().

Serialization process: Default Serialization process will be kicked-in for classes implementing  Serializable interface. Programmer defined Serialization process will be kicked-in for classes implementing Externalizable interface.

Maintenance: If any new Non-Serializable is added to Serializable Object, Serialization process will break at runtime. But it does not happen if you implement Externalizable. That new attribute won't be serialized unless you explicitly write it.

Backward Compatibility and Control: If you have to support multiple versions, you can have full control with Externalizable interface. You can support different versions of your object. If you implement Externalizable, it's your responsibility to serialize super class

public No-arg constructor:  Serializable uses reflection to construct object and does not require no arg constructor. But Externalizable demands public no-arg constructor.
