CSS:
-----
-->Why Use CSS?
	CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. 

-->CSS Solved a Big Problem ::

	HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

	HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

	<h1>This is a heading</h1>

	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	
-->CSS Syntax
	A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

	<CSSSelector>{   property: value;  property: value;}

	here CSS selector : The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
	Example  :: 
	p {
		color: red;
		text-align: center;
	}
-->CSS Selectors
	CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.
	i)The element Selector-- 
			p {
			text-align: center;
			color: red;
		}
	ii)The id Selector
		To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

			The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":

			Example
			#para1 {
				text-align: center;
				color: red;
			}
	iii) The class Selector
		To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.

			In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned:

			Example
			.center {
				text-align: center;
				color: red;
			}
			
-->You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

		In the example below, only <p> elements with class="center" will be center-aligned:

		Example
		p.center {
			text-align: center;
			color: red;
		}
		
-->Hexadecimal Colors
RGB values can also be specified using hexadecimal color values in the form: #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (same as decimal 0-255).
