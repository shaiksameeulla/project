Java Concurrency Interview Questions and Answers
=========================
What is atomic operation? What are atomic classes in Java Concurrency API?
Atomic operations are performed in a single unit of task without interference from other operations. Atomic operations are necessity in multi-threaded environment to avoid data inconsistency.

int++ is not an atomic operation. So by the time one thread read its value and increment it by one, another thread has read the older value leading to the wrong result.

To solve this issue, we will have to make sure that increment operation on count is atomic, we can do that using Synchronization but Java 5 java.util.concurrent.atomic provides wrapper classes for int and long that can be used to achieve this atomically without the usage of Synchronization. G


What is Lock interface in Java Concurrency API? What are its benefits over synchronization?
======================

Lock interface provides more extensive locking operations than can be obtained using synchronized methods and statements. They allow more flexible structuring, may have quite different properties and may support multiple associated Condition objects.
The advantages of a lock are

it’s possible to make them fair
it’s possible to make a thread responsive to interruption while waiting on a Lock object.
it’s possible to try to acquire the lock, but return immediately or after a timeout if the lock can’t be acquired
it’s possible to acquire and release locks in different scopes, and in different orders

Most of the times, synchronized keyword is the way to go but it has some shortcomings that lead the way to inclusion of Lock API in Java Concurrency package. Java 1.5 Concurrency API came up with java.util.concurrent.locks package with Lock interface and some implementation classes to improve the Object locking mechanism.

Some important interfaces and classes in Java Lock API are:

Lock: This is the base interface for Lock API. It provides all the features of synchronized keyword with additional ways to create different Conditions for locking, providing timeout for thread to wait for lock. Some of the important methods are lock() to acquire the lock, unlock() to release the lock, tryLock() to wait for lock for a certain period of time, newCondition() to create the Condition etc.
Condition: Condition objects are similar to Object wait-notify model with additional feature to create different sets of wait. A Condition object is always created by Lock object. Some of the important methods are await() that is similar to wait() and signal(), signalAll() that is similar to notify() and notifyAll() methods.
ReadWriteLock: It contains a pair of associated locks, one for read-only operations and another one for writing. The read lock may be held simultaneously by multiple reader threads as long as there are no writer threads. The write lock is exclusive.
ReentrantLock: This is the most widely used implementation class of Lock interface. This class implements the Lock interface in similar way as synchronized keyword. Apart from Lock interface implementation, ReentrantLock contains some utility methods to get the thread holding the lock, threads waiting to acquire the lock etc.
synchronized block are reentrant in nature i.e if a thread has lock on the monitor object and if another synchronized block requires to have the lock on the same monitor object then thread can enter that code block. I think this is the reason for the class name to be ReentrantLock. Let’s understand this feature with a simple example.


public class Test{

public synchronized foo(){
    //do something
    bar();
  }

  public synchronized bar(){
    //do some more
  }
}
If a thread enters foo(), it has the lock on Test object, so when it tries to execute bar() method, the thread is allowed to execute bar() method since it’s already holding the lock on the Test object i.e same as synchronized(this).

Java Lock Example – ReentrantLock in Java
Now let’s see a simple example where we will replace synchronized keyword with Java Lock API.

Let’s say we have a Resource class with some operation where we want it to be thread-safe and some methods where thread safety is not required.


package com.journaldev.threads.lock;

public class Resource {

	public void doSomething(){
		//do some operation, DB read, write etc
	}
	
	public void doLogging(){
		//logging, no need for thread safety
	}
}
Now let’s say we have a Runnable class where we will use Resource methods.


package com.journaldev.threads.lock;

public class SynchronizedLockExample implements Runnable{

	private Resource resource;
	
	public SynchronizedLockExample(Resource r){
		this.resource = r;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		synchronized (resource) {
			resource.doSomething();
		}
		resource.doLogging();
	}
}
Notice that I am using synchronized block to acquire the lock on Resource object. We could have created a dummy object in the class and used that for locking purpose.

Now let’s see how we can use java Lock API and rewrite above program without using synchronized keyword. We will use ReentrantLock in java.


package com.journaldev.threads.lock;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ConcurrencyLockExample implements Runnable{

	private Resource resource;
	private Lock lock;
	
	public ConcurrencyLockExample(Resource r){
		this.resource = r;
		this.lock = new ReentrantLock();
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		try {
			if(lock.tryLock(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)){
			resource.doSomething();
			}
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}finally{
			//release lock
			lock.unlock();
		}
		resource.doLogging();
	}

}
As you can see that, I am using tryLock() method to make sure my thread waits only for definite time and if it’s not getting the lock on object, it’s just logging and exiting. Another important point to note is the use of try-finally block to make sure lock is released even if doSomething() method call throws any exception.

Java Lock vs synchronized
Based on above details and program, we can easily conclude following differences between Java Lock and synchronization.

Java Lock API provides more visibility and options for locking, unlike synchronized where a thread might end up waiting indefinitely for the lock, we can use tryLock() to make sure thread waits for specific time only.
Synchronization code is much cleaner and easy to maintain whereas with Lock we are forced to have try-finally block to make sure Lock is released even if some exception is thrown between lock() and unlock() method calls.
synchronization blocks or methods can cover only one method whereas we can acquire the lock in one method and release it in another method with Lock API.
synchronized keyword doesn’t provide fairness whereas we can set fairness to true while creating ReentrantLock object so that longest waiting thread gets the lock first.
We can create different conditions for Lock and different thread can await() for different conditions.


What is Executors Framework?
In Java 5, Executor framework was introduced with the java.util.concurrent.Executor interface.

The Executor framework is a framework for standardizing invocation, scheduling, execution, and control of asynchronous tasks according to a set of execution policies.

Creating a lot many threads with no bounds to the maximum threshold can cause the application to run out of heap memory. So, creating a ThreadPool is a better solution as a finite number of threads can be pooled and reused. Executors framework facilitate the process of creating Thread pools in java. Check out this post to learn with example code to create thread pool using Executors framework.


What is BlockingQueue? How can we implement Producer-Consumer problem using Blocking Queue?
java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue is a Queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element.

BlockingQueue doesn’t accept null values and throw NullPointerException if you try to store null value in the queue.

BlockingQueue implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods are atomic in nature and use internal locks or other forms of concurrency control.

BlockingQueue interface is part of the Java collections framework and it’s primarily used for implementing the producer-consumer problem.
Check this post for producer-consumer problem implementation using BlockingQueue.


What is Callable and Future?
Java 5 introduced java.util.concurrent.Callable interface in concurrency package that is similar to Runnable interface but it can return any Object and able to throw Exception.

The Callable interface uses Generics to define the return type of Object. Executors class provide useful methods to execute Callable in a thread pool. Since callable tasks run in parallel, we have to wait for the returned Object. Callable tasks return java.util.concurrent.Future object. Using Future we can find out the status of the Callable task and get the returned Object. It provides the get() method that can wait for the Callable to finish and then return the result.
Check this post for Callable Future Example.


What is FutureTask Class?
FutureTask is the base implementation class of Future interface and we can use it with Executors for asynchronous processing. Most of the time we don’t need to use FutureTask class but it comes real handy if we want to override some of the methods of Future interface and want to keep most of the base implementation. We can just extend this class and override the methods according to our requirements. Check out Java FutureTask Example post to learn how to use it and what are different methods it has.


What are Concurrent Collection Classes?
Java Collection classes are fail-fast which means that if the Collection will be changed while some thread is traversing over it using iterator, the iterator.next() will throw ConcurrentModificationException.

Concurrent Collection classes support full concurrency of retrievals and adjustable expected concurrency for updates.
Major classes are ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet, check this post to learn how to avoid ConcurrentModificationException when using iterator.


What is Executors Class?
Executors class provide utility methods for Executor, ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService, ThreadFactory, and Callable classes.

Executors class can be used to easily create Thread Pool in java, also this is the only class supporting execution of Callable implementations.


What are some of the improvements in Concurrency API in Java 8?
Some important concurrent API enhancements are:

ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(), forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods.
CompletableFuture that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status).
Executors newWorkStealingPool() method to create a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level.
