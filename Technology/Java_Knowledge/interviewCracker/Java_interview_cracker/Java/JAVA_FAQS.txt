a) What's new in HTML5? b) CSS Box model and properties c) Javascript basics d) Then linkedlist question, sum of two numbers represented by linked lists e) reverse a phrase without using tokenizers Answered all of them, interviewer expected that I would take time for coding questions, but I completed them in less than 5 mins. 3) Second round is of approx 2 hours. The interviewer asked me so many questions on DS, Algorithms, SQL, Threading etc... Answered all of them. He is super impressed with me. 4) Third round is with manager, he gave me a question like this. I tried my level best, then asked some theory questions, what is Heap Memory and Program Memory, How is java class loader works. Implement a queue a) Enqueue happens at 100 messages/sec with one thread. b) Dequeue happens at 10 messages/sec with 5 threads. c) At any time the number of unprocessed messages pushed to backlog. When the number of messages in backlog increases 1000, stop incoming messages until number of messages in backlog decreases to 500.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291836/concurrenthashmap-vs-synchronized-hashmap


1. Difference between concurrent map and synchronized map ? No implementation details , just the difference 
2. Volatile variables and synchornization 
3. final classes 
4. Callable and future and what they do. 
5. Write a java program for finding out the first non repeating character in string. Example you have a string abcdeabc. Here the output must be d. Prepare this question, they will definitely ask you. 
6. Read a file for a sequence of input string and print in in some order to output file.
 7. You have a list of integers using an arraylist, find first if it contains duplicates, if doesn't contain duplicates, then return false else return true. Second part was to find that the duplicate elements. I am sure the interviewer might not be very sharp, however when you divide an array size by 2 , he was asking to round off an integer, which would be anyway a round off figure. I didn't understand what he wanted to prove , he is dumb or he is sharp !!!

what are the different scopes of spring bean lifecycle?

 Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)
