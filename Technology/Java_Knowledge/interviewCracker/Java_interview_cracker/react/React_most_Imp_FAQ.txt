React Faq:
============
1. Hooks : useState, useEffect with dependency array (empty, with value), useContext, useReducer,useMemo,useCallback,useRef
2.Higher Order Comp : when what why how to use.

1. Hooks
useState
useEffect ( significance of dependency array eg. what happens when its empty, when it has some value, when its not there)
useContext
useReducer
useMemo
useCallback
useRef

2. Higher order compoents
what is it?
when to use it?
why we use it?
how we use it? (prepare an example)

3. Life cycle Methods of the compoenets 
the three phases and all its methods, the order in which it is called etc.

4.State management 
all about state and prop
prop drilling (with example and significance of useContext here)

5. Redux and zustand
how redux works?
why do we need redux?
when do we need redux? (should be able to justify the reason you used redux)
Redux Toolkit(RTK)

6.Custom Hooks
when to use it?
code it with an example
(makes our code clean, reusauble and maintainable)

7. lazy loading
can also be asked as chunking, code splliting, chunking
(Makes our application performant)

8. Virtual DOM  [very important]
Learn these concepts to get a deep understanding
diffing algorithm
react- fiber
reconcilation algorithm
How react renders a component?
how react re-renders the component?

9. Client Side rendering(CSR) and Server Side Rendering(SSR) (HOT Topic ðŸ˜›)
what is it?
Difference between the two
Learn about the SEO and performance

10. React Router
How do we manage protected routes?
Role based access control?
how do we handle routes?
query params and how we handle it?
Dynamic Routing?

11. Testing (unit testing)
what u use to write React tests?

12. Async Task
make API calls?
what will happen when u scroll, click
(understand useeEfect and how it works behind the scene)
Promises (must know)


use keywords like re-usable, modular, testable,  maintainable. 
13. Focus on the Performance (improve user expereince asset optimization, lazy loading, shimmer UI, optimazation at bundler level, CDN level, server level)
14. Styling  (pros and cons of using Tailwind over bootstrap vice versa and so on....) 
15. Accessebility , security, performace, testability (these are the pillars of any application)


How do you optimize ::: bundler level optimization , asset level, CDN, css level, react level, javascript level, writing optimize the code.
