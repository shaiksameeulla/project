class vs object:
==============
A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

Framework CSS:
-----------
bootstrap,material

visibility:hidden : takes space
 display : none  : no space

Padding vs marin:
-------------

In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.

== and ===

javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.

setTimeout and setInterval

setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time. setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval


let,var, const

if you never want a variable to change, const is the keyword to use. If you want to reassign values: and you want the hoisting behavior, var is the keyword to use. if you don't want it, let is the keyword for you

advantages of react:

props, contextapi redux

useState hook:

state vs props, which are mutable/immutable

pass data amoung various component which are not nested : we can use context api

Difference b/w useState and ContextAPI

which state to keep in same useState vs Redux state?

what are react hooks?
