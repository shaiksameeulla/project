React lifecycle 
================

Render phase : Pure and has no side effects. May be paused, aborted or restarted by React.
“Pre-commit phase” : Can read the DOM.
“Commit phase” : Can work with DOM, run side effects, schedule updates.


 React Component can go through four stages of its life as follows. 

Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.
Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.
Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.
Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page.


Mounting(Render phase)	
		-->constructor(Render phase)-->static getDerivedStateFromProps()(Render phase)---->render(Render phase)
		-->React updates DOM and refs(Commit phase)--->componentDidMount(Commit phase)


Updating(Render phase)
	-->New props(Render phase)-->set­State(Render phase)--->force­Update()-->render(Render phase) 
	-->React updates ­D­O­M and refs(Commit phase)--->componentDidUpdate(Commit phase)
   
   componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)


Unmounting(Render phase)
	----->componentWillUnmount(Commit phase)

         componentWillUnmount()
