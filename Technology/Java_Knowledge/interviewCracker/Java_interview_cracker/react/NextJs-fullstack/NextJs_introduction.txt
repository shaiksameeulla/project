NextJs
===========
1. its fullstack framework for react production ready application

Key Features:
-------------
1. react is client side rendering application  but NextJs suppors server side rendering.
	 client side rendering means when we inspect the page we see empty except root div.
2. server side rendering could optimize search engine crawlers.
3. reactjs has an option for serverside rendering ReactDOMServer  which need some setup.
4. but NextJs has inbuilt server side rendering  which is outof the box.
   
   
 KeyFeature 1:  NextJs serverside rendering :
    -> Automatic page  prerendering : great for SEO(SearchEngineOptimization) and inital load
	-> blending client side  and server-side , Fetch data on server  and render  finished pages.
KeyFeature 2:  NextJs Simplified routing with  FileBased Routing :
      -> Reactjs does not have built in support for routing but we need to import other lib for routing
	     and also we need to setup route for each pages.
	--> NextJs : Defines  pages and routing  with files and folders instead of code.
	-->  less code ,less work and highly understandable 
KeyFeature 3: building fullstack application
	-> easily  add backedn (server side  ) code to  your next /reactapps
	--> storing data, getting data  ,authentication  etc can be  added to your react  project.
