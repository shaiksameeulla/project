A DDoS attack enables a hacker to flood a network or server with bogus traffic. Too much traffic overloads resources and disrupts connectivity, stopping the system from processing genuine user requests. Services become unavailable, and the target company suffers prolonged downtime, lost revenue, and dissatisfied customers.


	A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a cyberattack that aims to crash a network, service, or server by flooding the system with fake traffic. The sudden spike in messages, connection requests, or packets overwhelms the target's infrastructure and causes the system to slow down or crash.

While some hackers use DDoS attacks to blackmail a business into paying a ransom (similar to ransomware), more common motives behind a DDoS are to:

Disrupt services or communications.
Inflict brand damage.
Gain a business advantage while a competitor's website is down.
Distract the incident response team.
DDoS attacks are a danger to businesses of all sizes, from Fortune 500 companies to small e-retailers. Statistically, DDoS hackers most often target:

Online retailers.
IT service providers.
Financial and fintech companies.
Government entities.
Online gaming and gambling companies.


Types of DDoS Attacks
-------------------------


The three main types of attack are:

Application-layer attacks.
Protocol attacks.
Volumetric attacks.
The three approaches rely on different techniques, but a skilled hacker can employ all three strategies to overwhelm a single target.
