throttle vs debounce:


Debouncing v/s Throttling in JavaScript?
It is important to note that throttle and debounce are very similar because both increase the speed of web applications. They are, however, employed in distinct contexts. We use debouncing when we worry about the final outcome. For instance, waiting until a user finishes typing to retrieve typeahead search results.

When we wish to manage all steps in the process at a controlled rate, a throttle is a perfect tool to utilize. Track the scrolling offsets when the user scrolls across the web application, for example, and request some content from an API or animate particular portions instead of waiting for the user to complete.


Why use Throttling in JavaScript?
Throttling functions generate function calls at a predetermined rate. Throttling the callbacks prevents the app from lagging or overloading your server with requests while performing a time-consuming computation or an API request in the event handler callback function.


Use cases for throttling
Action games
Scroll event listeners
Button click listeners
