throttling
==========
for expensive function we want to limit the frequency of function invocation.

With throttling, you limit the frequency of function invocations. For example, you might decide to execute a function at most once every 1500 milliseconds. This prevents the function from being called too frequently and helps maintain a smoother performance.

Example: In this example, a button with the id ‘throttle’ is equipped with a throttling mechanism using a custom throttle function. When clicked, the associated callback function, logging ‘button is clicked’ to the console, is throttled to execute at most once every 1500 milliseconds.



Advantages of throttling function: 
It prevents frequent calling of the function.
It makes the website faster and controls the rate at which a particular function is called.
Performance Optimization.
Improved Responsiveness.




<button id="throttle">Click Me</button>


    <script>
        const btn = document.querySelector("#throttle");
 
        // Throttling Function
        const throttleFunction = (func, delay) => {
 
            // Previously called time of the function
            let prev = 0;
            return (...args) => {
                // Current called time of the function
                let now = new Date().getTime();
 
                // Logging the difference
                // between previously 
                // called and current called timings
                console.log(now - prev, delay);
 
                // If difference is greater
                // than delay call
                // the function again.
                if (now - prev > delay) {
                    prev = now;

                    // operator here 
                    // returning the function with the 
                    // array of arguments
