POsition : absolute vs relative.
=============================
1. by default position has static and it does not effect top,left,right,bottom attribute
2. position: relative current window relative postion, we can use top,left,right,bottom  to define spacing.
<div>
  <img1>
  <img2>  if we apply position: relative to this element , then this will be relative to  current window position
  <img3>
  <img4>
</div>
observation : positioning relative to window, when add top,left,right,bottom to image to , then img2 can move the position but space maintained (img2 space remains empty)
 
3. gap maintained for the relative attribute.
4. Position : absolute to the closet postion ancester , whose postion is relative, heere it doesnot maintain any gap
   if we want overlap the element then we can use absolute position property

<div> relative
  <img1>
  <img2>if we apply position: absolute to this element , then this will be relative to  nearest  position ancester whose postion is relative
  <img3>
  <img4>
</div>
 then image2 comes on top of image3. hence image 3 hides behind image2
 
5. fixed position : position of the element is intact
	Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.


6. sticky position : we need to define the position to make sticky, this will also behaves same as fixed
	Sticky - the element is positioned based on the userâ€™s scroll position.



then what is the difference b/w fixed vs sticky?
---------------------------------------------

The main difference is that the 'fixed' position sets the position of the HTML elements according to the viewport, and the 'sticky' position sets the position according to the parent element
