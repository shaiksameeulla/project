		SCSS files are processed by the server running a web app to output a traditional CSS that your browser can understand.

		Sass â€“ Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

		Sass is a language that provides features to make it easier to deal with complex styling compared to editing raw .css. An example of such a feature is allowing definition of variables that can be re-used in different styles.

		The language has two alternative syntaxes:

			A JSON like syntax that is kept in files ending with .scss (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets)
			A YAML like syntax that is kept in files ending with .sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
			Either of these must be compiled to .css files which are recognized by browsers.

13 : why do we use @import at the top?
   The @import rule allows you to import a style sheet into another style sheet. The @import rule must be at the top of the document (but after any @charset declaration). The @import rule also supports media queries, so you can allow the import to be media-dependent.
   this is to avoid any overriding rules.
14. z-index?
	The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
    An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
    
	Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).

   Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top
