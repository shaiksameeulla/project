morgan stanley:
==================	

How does the garbage collector works?

===
Firstly Morgan Stanley sent me the hackerrank test link in which most of the questions were from Java and 1 coding question. I got the mail for an interview after a month and they scheduled my interview on the very next day so I did not get much time to prepare and revise all the concepts. But the interviewer was very nice he was helping me with every question. I screwed my interview myself. You just need to revise every topic thoroughly and deep understanding of Hashmap, Collections, and threading.

Interview Questions
Reverse the given linked list

Some very basic questions on problem solving.

Questions on hashmap, immutable class, string, Serializable, Collections

===
I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Morgan Stanley in Aug 2021

Interview
Contractor position - so contacted by third party recruiter.
2 rounds of interviews both of them were related to problem solving and lasted for 60 minutes.
Main focus - Linked list , algorithms , angular ( it was there in my resume)

Interview Questions
1) sum of last 10 nodes of linked list then write unit test then about complexity of algorithm
Answer Question
2) angular related questions like what is promise/observable . What is ngrx store , what is change detection, what is AOT
Answer Question
3)Design algorithm to convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal number
Answer Question
4) design linked list in JAVA as position was JAVA developer

=====
- Interview process consists of 5 round
- 1st Round - Online coding test ( 3 Java coding questions - medium level)
- 2nd round - Technical Interview ( Core Java questions with Coding as well focus was on multithreading)
- 3rd round - Technical Interview ( Java questions and logic in deep with Coding)
- 4th round - Managerial (Project domain knowledge, processes followed, core java questions mostly on mutithreading, coding as well)

Interview Questions
1) How ConcurrentHash Map works
2) Blocking queue implementation
3) write code for producer consumer problem
4) write code to print even odd in sequence using MultiThreading

=====
fundamental core java :hashcode and equal: if it's good to return a fixed integer in the hashcode method;linkedlist arraylist;hashmap;deep copy. what is the Polymorphism and Generic.
write my own string class tool.
some basic algorithm:find top 5 words in an article;

Interview Questions
describe your understanding in hashcode() and equal().
=======
1.Round Hacker Rank -90 minutes
2. Zoom video call - Some general Java concepts
and some programs .

I was very confident that all is going good. I had completed all the given programs and they are working as expected for all the test cases. Given answer to all the theoretical questions.
But don’t know intervewer say that she is expecting some other answers. I dint know why interviewers think that approach/solution to a problem will be the same as they know or think.
Every technical problem can be solved in many ways. Anyways you can not control the decision.

Interview Questions
Design Vending Machine
Buy/ Sale Stock - Find the day when you will have the max profit.

=============
There were 4 rounds. First round will be hackerank test consist of MCQs and Program. Difficulty was moderate. Then 3 F2F round interview. First round, interviewer asked me all the core java questions from all the topics including exceptions handling, collections, generic, String etc. Core java concepts should be good to clear the round, 2 coding questions were also there on hacker rank codepair. 1. Find the 2nd largest number in array without using any inbuilt method in O(n), 2. print fibonaci series till n, without using recursion. My 2nd and 3rd round taken together. Interviewer asked 4 programs to write on notepad. 1. find intersection noide of two linkedlist.2 find all the cousins of the node in BST. 3. Implement stack using Queue.4. print the number in english words for ex;4563 should be printed as "four thousand six hundred three.

why to implement hashcode and equals in java
Notify and NotifyAll
Thread safety in singleton
Static methods cannot be overridden because they are not dispatched on the object instance at runtime.
How ConcurrentHashMap Works Internally in Java
==========
Interview
I have more than 20 years of experience in Software Development. I applied to Morgan Stanley 4-5 times. All these times I did not get an offer because of 2 reasons:

1. I've been asked questions about garbage collection, memory etc. like I am just graduated student. I know many developers who worked in MS and none of them ever used skills and knowledge that they were asked during interview.

2. The hiring process takes so long time that usually I had to decline the next interview because I have already got an offer from another company.

If MS really working on the new JVM then I can understand those questions. Otherwise, may be you could consider asking more experience related questions? May be you could consider conducting 2-3 interviews during 2 weeks instead of 7-10 in 3 months or more?
If you think that I am wrong and your interviews just selects the best of the best then I am sorry for everything written here and I will be just always declining any positions in Morgan Stanley.

Interview Questions
Garbage Collection, Memory Leaks, Java Collections implementations.

========

1) Print Binary tree in spiral order
2) Given mapping between city to city, print complete path from source city till destination city.

I solved both problems correctly and submitted the paper in 45 minutes.

After 1 hour of submission HR asked me to leave for the day. I said what??

I asked HR to recheck my paper and bring back the answer sheet I submitted.

After coming back home, I wrote the programs in laptop and both were giving expected result.

3 things comes up as a result:
1) Either their interviewer panel are not capable enough to understand recursive code
2) They made this women drive just for showcasing that they do conduct women drive like other big brands
3) They havn't checked the copy at all and just assembled crowd for marketing Morgan Stanley as best place to work for women.

What is the point of taking written test when you guys are not evaluating the solution? Please don't waster people's weekend by conducting fake drives.

Attached is my answer sheet copy submitted to Morgan Stanley.

From last 2 weeks they have followed up several times for confirming my presence, just to get crowd of people for marketing their brand.
Might be doing these activities they want to brand their name as best place to work for women employees.

Interview Questions

Answer Question
4) how do you handle if in production if you got outofmemory error
5) explain conncurrent hashmap.
6) Design your own load balancer

================

stage one: Basic introductory interview, run-through of your CV and some questions around Java, Spring, data structures, etc. All knowledge based questions which are easy to answer as long as you know the domain well (1h) Stage two: Coding interview. Two coding questions, around Leetcode "easy" level (1h) Stage three: Behavioural interview with a very senior lead/developer. Run-through of CV and your experience, with some behavioural type questions (30m) < Rejected after this Stage four: Would be HR round (if 3rd stage is passed) All stages fine apart from the third which was tricky. I was a little nervous and my answers weren't particulary good. The interviewer was nice but I could tell there was a lack of interest. My advice here is to be calm and take your time with answering, don't rush. Last interviewer also expressed some concern about my lack of financial background, and how it was a steep learning curve. I suggest showing some enthusiasm/basic knowledge of finance to alleviate this Another tip: - Dress and look smart. It's an investment bank so even the engineers dress smart here.

I applied online. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Morgan Stanley (Bengaluru) in Mar 2022

Interview
First I received a link from Morgan Stanley for the hackerrank exam. All of the questions were on java and 1 question on DS.

Then I received a call from HR that I cleared the test.
Next I went through technical interviews, where I got rejected.

Interview Questions
They asked questions on Java cocepts like : OOPS, Multithreading, Collections.

They will show you code snippet, you have to tell the output and with that you will have to discuss the above topic in depth with interviewer.
They will usually ask edge cases.

Ex: What if we implement 2 interfaces having same name and same signature for a default method. How to solve this problem.

Ex2: Why we can create constructor in abstract class but we cannot initialize it. Why java introduced this?

Ex:3 What if we override equals method and hashcode method. What if we are returning same value from hashcode method and always returning false from equals method.

Ex: 4 If in a class having two different methods with two synchronized blocks and two threads are accessing different methods, What will happen? who will wait?

Interview
Applied through LinkedIn of recruiting agency.
They called me to incorp me discussing hourly rate and skills.
They sent my RTR to Morgan stanley.
After 2-3 weeks, MS asked for first interview availability.
Got no response after that.
3-4 weeks after, they said I cleared first interview, asked for 2nd interview availability.
No response after that...

Interview Questions
Difference between equals and hashcode method?

=======================
nterview
Interview consisted of 4 rounds.I have cleared first round and post that I have gotten an email stating further 3 rounds are scheduled .After my 2nd round I was waiting for 3rd round to happen which did not and there was not any communication about that also. I have emailed HR but there was no response.Finally after a day I got an automated email stating not selected. Ideally if the rounds are like elimination they should be informed first instead of scheduling all and blocking our time and without giving proper updates.This is pathetic

Interview Questions
Multithreading and Concurrency
Hashmap
Blocking queue
LinkedHashMap Implementation
Immutable class Implementation
Design notepad with search functionality

====================

Application
I applied through a staffing agency. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Morgan Stanley (Bengaluru) in Jul 2020

Interview
The number of rounds are not fixed , it depends on team to team.For me there was 4. I could reach up to R3. - Telephonic,Zoom Call, Telephonic-Design and Aptitude question.
R1 - Most question on thread and collection framework and couple of implementation question.
R2- String based ds question and collection internal functionality. There was extensive discussion on GC and GC algorithms . Questions on transaction management and complex SQL queries(Joins).
R3- Interview with senior manager in MS . This was the worst round as the interviewer was not interested . He started with basic interface question and then went upto open ended design questions. He further went up to Queue DS - how DQ works and blocking queue .This person did not agree to any answer and seems very disinterested in talking the round.

HR called me and told the feedback is not that positive and we will reschedule your interview to another team as we have multiple requirement and all crap . But later they sent a rejection mail.

Interview Questions
Q- How to find whether if a permutation of a string can be a palindrome ?
Q- Find sum of two number =K in an sorted and unsorted array?
Q-Hashmap internal working and where can you use identityHashMap
Q-Design a realtime dashboard where you would display top 10 players in a game.
Q-Design an algorithm to schedule a match within N teams where each match is elimination?How would you handle if you have N%2=1(where N is odd)? On what basis you would sit out a team and play another
Q-How would you send and receive XML as Req and Res in REST
Q-How would you inject a prototype bean into Singleton bean
Q-What are the alternatives to Databases ? How can you compute 1 billion records in a distributed system? How would you breakdown data and remerge the results across distributed systems.
Q- Find the longest prefix of words in a string of array
Q- MQ vs Rest Services - Which is best in what scenario?
Q- In what scenario thread becomes heavy weight ?

=======================

One Hacker rank test followed by 4 technical rounds and an HR round.

Interview
I applied through a recruitment agency. The drive was conducted on a Saturday. There were quite a number of people who came to the drive. They grouped us on basis of Technology.

The first round was a written test which consisted of total 14 questions. 10 multiple choice questions, 2 programming questions and 2 sql queries questions.

Multiple choice questions were easy. Programming questions were difficult and sql queries questions were easy too.

I cleared the written test. Then began the second round. I could not clear the second round. The questions were difficult in second round and you need to write down code for everything that you say.

Interview Questions
I have an array of million integers. I want to sum it efficiently. How would you do it without using Java 8 parallel streams?
3 Answers
I have a collection of string that is sorted and unique. You will receive an input as string. Your job is to search that string in that group and return true or false based on its presence. How will you solve this?

I got in the process for experienced position via Agent. i submitted cv and got a date for first screening interview round in Morgan Stanley Tokyo.

That round went well. They just asked basic question about what i do and past experience.

I got rejection after 1 week.

Just one request to company : if you are shortlisting someone for position, atleast have a technical interview to know how they are stronger in skills.

Interview Questions
Some basic puzzle like burning rope from two ends. and questions on past experience ( not detailed )

===========
I applied through a staffing agency. The process took 5 weeks. I interviewed at Morgan Stanley (New York, NY) in Aug 2018

Interview
I got a call through a consultancy and went to their campus on a Saturday. It was a drive for around 35-40 candidates.

1. Written Exam (45 mins)
There were 10 code snippets based MCQs totally based on java. They were easy and can be easily answered if you are attempting after few days of preparation.
There were also 2 programs and 2 SQL based questions.
But they were strict about time i.e. 45 minutes which is less.

2. F2F Discussion (Normal Java Round)
This discussion was totally based on Java.
All the common topics like immutability, interface, Abstract class, singleton pattern, multithreading, collections were covered.

3. F2F Discussion (Design Round)
I was asked to create a design for a problem statement by the interviewer. The main things that were targeted were Multithreading, choice of datastructures and the controller logic like polling etc.

4. Telephonic Discusssion (NY)
I had a discussion with their on-site developer. We discussed about java and basics of multithreading and then a bit about sql. BTW only two candidates made till this round.

They informed me that i ll have a telephonic round with MD in coming days and then managerial and hr rounds..

5. Then after one week i had a discussion with MD (NY). Discussion was about aspirations and job requirement.

6. After continuously following up for 2 weeks , they set up a F2F managerial discussion(pro-fit round) with Senior VP. Discussion was high level technical and about salary expectation.

7. Telephonic HR discussion on salary expectation.


After these rounds, HR asked me to wait for couple of days so that they can come up with a number.

They didn't call back despite of many follow up calls and mails.
Finally HR told me that the position has gone on-hold. :(

So i would suggest others to don't wait too much or put all your hopes on it.
