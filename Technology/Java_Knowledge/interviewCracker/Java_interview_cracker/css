A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear its child elements, so that you don't need to add additional markup. It's generally used in float layouts where elements are floated to be stacked horizontally.

The clearfix is a way to combat the zero-height container problem for floated elements

The clearfix allows a container to wrap its floated children. Without a clearfix or equivalent styling, a container does not wrap around its floated children and collapses, just as if its floated children were positioned absolutely.

There are several versions of the clearfix,

 although more modern browsers are coming with even more useful layout mechanisms under names like flexbox, grid layout, etc.
 
 .group::before,
.group::after {
  content: " ";
  display: table;
}
.group::after {
  clear: both;
}
.group {
  zoom: 1; /** for backward compatability*/
}

The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.

For a positioned box (that is, one with any position other than static), the z-index property specifies:

The stack level of the box in the current stacking context.
Whether the box establishes a local stacking context

The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.
