What is Helm?


Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the K8s equivalent of yum or apt. It accomplishes the same goals as Linux system package managers like APT or YUM: managing the installation of applications and dependencies behind the scenes and hiding the complexity from the user.

 A Helm chart is a package that contains all the necessary resources to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes YAML configuration files for deployments, services, secrets, and config maps that define the desired state of your application.
 
 A Helm client is a command-line utility for end users to control local chart development and manage repositories and releases. Just like using the MySQL database client to run MySQL commands, you use the Helm client to run Helm commands.
 
 
 Helm repositories
	The Helm repository is where you can upload Helm charts. You can also create a private repository to share charts within your organization. Artifact Hub is a global Helm repository that features searchable charts that you can install for numerous purposes. In short, Artifact Hub does for Helm charts what Docker Hub does for Docker images

 Releases
	A running instance of a chart is known as a release. When you run the helm install command, it pulls the config and chart files and deploys all the Kubernetes resources.
