AWS Cloud Development Kit(CDK) - From Beginner to Professional

Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions, write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages. AWS CDK uses the familiar and expressive power of programming languages.

AWS CDK gives you components preconfigured with proven defaults, without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation.
