Trees:
Binary trees:
 strict binary tree : where child node has 0 or 2 nodes 
 full binary tree : every node should have two nodes and all leaf nodes should be at the same level
 complete binary tree : where all the nodes are on a level l or l-1 
 
 height : childs are node(longest path from root to leaf node is called height of the node) [maximum depth of the tree]
 depth :  no of edges in the path frpm root to that node(
 
 
 fullbinary tree:
 The number of nodes, n, in a full binary tree is atleast n = 2h – 1, and atmost n = 2^h+1 – 1, where h is the height of the tree.
The number of leaf nodes l, in a full binary tree is number, L of internal nodes + 1, i.e, l = L+1.
